# pstmrtm
pstmrtm.net is a liminal space ARG (Alternate Reality Game) set across fractured timelines, abandoned spaces, and forgotten digital echoes.
It is not a game you can win — only something you can become lost inside.

This project blends surreal environments, cryptic narratives, hidden interactions, and fragmented realities designed to evoke unease, wonder, and the inescapable sense that something is wrong — but familiar.

This is an open-world exploration of the in-between.
You are invited, but you are not welcome.
You are expected, but you were never meant to arrive.
