    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>PSTMRTM was an experimental initiative designed to preserve fragmented consciousness data across distributed nodes.  
    The project was abandoned following emergent instability and systemic decay.</p>
    <p>Residual artifacts remain accessible via the pstmrtm.net interface.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>pstmrtm.net is an ambient, interactive experience.  
    It explores fragmented spaces, forgotten communications, and the hollow echoes of abandoned systems.  
    It is not a traditional game.  
    There are no clear objectives.  
    There is no safety.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>You navigate by exploring.</p>
    <p>Some locations are visible. Others are hidden.  
    Artifacts will appear.  
    Clues may not reveal themselves immediately.</p>
    <p><em>Persistence will not always be rewarded, but absence will guarantee nothing.</em></p>
  </div>
